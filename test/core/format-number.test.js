// The one grouping both the `hyp sync` consent prompt and the overview tables
// render counts through. Its whole point is that the string does not depend on
// the machine: #1117 was a locale pin that a US-locale box could not tell from
// no pin at all, and the substitution helper written to see that (deleted with
// #1121) could only reach one of the two ways to ask the host for grouping.
// So these cases assert exact strings and never consult a locale - a pin that
// reads the same on every box and under every ICU build, including the
// `small-icu` and `--without-intl` ones that have no `de-DE` to substitute.
